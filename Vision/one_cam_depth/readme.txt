polyfit provides the necessary data points to be fed into the matlab polyfit tool.The obtained fit is used in the main file to give a direct estimate of the distance between the camera and a fully visible AR tag in the input video feed. This method is not ideal and should be used as a backup if stereo vision fails. Poly fit must be optimized by taking more measurments, images provided are for demonstration purpuses and dont provide a very precise measurment, still need to take distortion into account...
